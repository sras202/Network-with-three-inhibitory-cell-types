# Network-with-three-inhibitory-cell-types
My first repository on analysis of a network with three inhibitory cell types in layer 2/3 of  mouse visual cortex
Cell type specific connectivity patterns exists in cortical neurons comprising excitatory pyramidal cells and inhibitory neurons expressing Parvalbumin (PV), Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide (VIP) and Somatostatin (SST) leading to distinct response of each subtype.
